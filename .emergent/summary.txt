The trajectory documents an iterative process of refining a mocked Expo frontend application based on continuous user feedback. The initial state was a structured Expo project with a non-functional mocked UI and persistent EAS build failures. The work pivoted to creating a single, self-contained  file to simplify user testing via a copy-paste workflow, likely in Expo Snack.

The AI engineer's primary task became a series of rapid debugging and feature implementation cycles within this single file. Key user requests included fixing parsing errors (e.g., incorrect string escaping), adding core e-commerce functionalities (working favorites, product images, seller shop creation, admin credit approval), implementing a speak with seller chat feature, and addressing UI/UX issues like incorrect screen sizing and missing logos.

The process was reactive, with the AI providing a complete  code block after each user request. A significant portion of the conversation was dedicated to debugging, including a critical error where the AI's explanatory text was mistakenly copied into the user's code. Later, the AI provided detailed instructions on preparing for a Google Play Store release, including  configuration and asset creation. The final interaction involved fixing a crucial JavaScript error ( vs. ) that prevented logins, restoring missing admin features, and delivering what is intended to be the final, fully-functional mocked .

<product_requirements>
The project is Leemaz, a native mobile e-commerce application for Syrian women entrepreneurs, intended to mirror an existing web app. The platform supports three roles: Buyer, Seller, and Admin.

**Core Features Required:**
-   User registration and role selection (Buyer/Seller).
-   Sellers can create and manage their own shops, including adding products with images and descriptions.
-   Buyers can browse products, view product images, add items to a favorites page, place orders (cash-on-delivery), and initiate chats with sellers.
-   An Admin role is required for managing the platform, specifically to approve/reject credit requests from sellers.
-   The app must be bilingual (Arabic/English) with RTL support.
-   Branding requires the Leemaz butterfly logo to be present on the welcome/login screen and as an icon within the app header.

**Implementation Status & Key Issues Addressed:**
The application exists as a single-file, mocked frontend () for Expo Snack. Development has focused on implementing the UI/UX for the above features. Recent user feedback addressed non-functional favorites, missing product images, lack of shop/product creation for sellers, missing credit approval for admins, and incorrect screen sizing. The latest version aims to resolve all these mocked functionalities.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo**: The primary framework for mobile development.
-   **Single-File Architecture**: Development shifted to a monolithic  for simplicity in Expo Snack, containing all components, screens, state, and mock data.
-   **State Management ()**: All application state (current user, screen, forms, mock data) is managed locally within the  component using React hooks.
-   **Mock Data**: The entire application runs on hardcoded JavaScript objects for users, shops, and products, with no backend connection.
-   **EAS Build & **: Configuration for building and deploying the app, a topic of discussion but not yet resolved.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project's codebase has transitioned from a standard Expo file-based routing structure to a single-file application for ease of use in a tool like Expo Snack. The primary development now occurs in a monolithic  file.

**High-Level Directory Structure (Initial):**


**File Analysis:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the most critical file. It contains the entire mocked frontend application, including all UI components, screens, navigation logic, state management (), mock data (users, products, shops), and all business logic (login, registration, adding to favorites, creating shops). The user's workflow is to copy and paste the entire content of this file into their environment.
    -   **Recent Changes**: The final version (from Chat Message 70) includes significant fixes:
        -   Corrected a logical error in modal rendering (e.g.,  instead of the erroneous ). This was a critical fix that was preventing the app from loading correctly.
        -   Restored admin panel functionality (buttons for managing users, products, shops) which was accidentally removed in a previous iteration.
        -   Adjusted the root  style to use  to fix screen sizing issues.
        -   Added the Leemaz logo to the login screen for better branding.
        -   The full, corrected code is:
          
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file configures the Expo app's metadata, including its name, version, icon, and splash screen. It is essential for the build and deployment process.
    -   **Recent Changes**: While not directly edited in the trajectory, there was a detailed discussion (Messages 54-62) about how the user should configure this file for a Google Play Store release, including setting the  name and defining paths for  and  images.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Integration**: The frontend is entirely mocked. All user actions (login, ordering, creating shops/products, chat) need to be connected to the actual FastAPI backend.
-   **Resolve EAS Build Failures**: The original problem of the app failing to build a standalone Android APK/AAB via EAS remains unaddressed.
-   **Google Play Store Submission**: The user has been given instructions but has not yet completed the process of building the app and submitting it.
-   **App Icon Implementation**: While the logo is in the UI, the actual app icon (visible on the phone's home screen) needs to be configured via  and the corresponding asset files.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was a critical bug fix and feature restoration based on user feedback. The user reported that a previous version of the code was completely broken, preventing login for all account types (buyer, seller, admin).

The AI engineer investigated and found a JavaScript error in the main render logic. The code was incorrectly attempting to call modal rendering functions directly (e.g., ), which caused a crash. The state variables for controlling modal visibility should have been used instead (e.g., ).

In response, the AI engineer provided a complete, corrected version of the  file. This final version (from Chat Message 70) addressed the following:
1.  **Corrected Modal Logic**: Fixed all instances of the incorrect modal rendering calls, which resolved the critical login failure.
2.  **Restored Admin Features**: Re-implemented the full set of admin functionalities (Manage Users, Manage Products, Shop Management, etc.) that were reported as missing.
3.  **Fixed Screen Sizing**: Applied  and  from  to the root view's style to ensure the app fits the device screen correctly.
4.  **Logo on Welcome Page**: Added the Leemaz logo to the initial login screen for consistent branding.

The immediate work was concluded by delivering this fully revised and functional mocked application code to the user for them to copy, paste, and test.

<optional_next_step>
Await user confirmation that the latest version of  resolves all previously reported issues, including the login failure, missing admin features, and incorrect screen sizing.
