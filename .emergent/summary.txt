The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Leemaz e-commerce app, specifically debugging and fixing a broken logo display. The core issue was a corrupted base64 string for the  constant in . The engineer successfully located the correct  asset and generated a valid base64 representation. Multiple attempts to update  using  and  failed, leading to the use of a Python script. While  output after the Python script suggested a successful fix, the AI's final thought indicated a perceived remnant of the old corrupted string, necessitating further verification of the replacement. The user had previously confirmed the overall plan, including this logo fix, and future improvements.

<product_requirements>
The Leemaz project is an Expo-based mobile e-commerce application targeting Syrian women entrepreneurs, complementing an existing web platform. It must support three distinct user roles: Buyers (browse, favorites, contact sellers), Sellers (create shops, upload images), and Admins (platform oversight, credit requests). The current prototype features hardcoded data and logic within a single  file, a cash-on-delivery flow, and mocked push notifications. Branding requires consistent use of the official Leemaz logo, which was recently fixed. The app needs full bilingual (English/Arabic) support with Right-to-Left (RTL) layout. The monolithic  structure is a known prototype limitation, slated for future refactoring.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Native/Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development framework.
- **Single-File Architecture**:  contains all frontend logic.
- **Base64 Images**: Logo embedded as data URI.
- **State Management**:  hook for local component state.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Bilingual (EN/AR) and RTL support using a translations object and .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monolithic architecture, with the entire frontend contained within a single  file.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: This is the primary frontend file, containing all React components, state, mock data, i18n strings, and styles.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  constant was targeted for replacement. An unused style () was removed. Multiple attempts to replace a corrupted base64 string with a valid one were made using various tools, eventually succeeding with a Python script, though full verification is pending.
-   **/app/App_COMPLETE.js**
    -   **Importance**: A stable backup of the application's frontend.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No changes made.
-   **/app/test_result.md**
    -   **Importance**: Contains detailed product requirements, the original , and testing protocols.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Read at the start of the current work session.
-   **/app/frontend/assets/images/leemaz-logo.png**
    -   **Importance**: The original image asset for the Leemaz logo.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was accessed to generate the correct base64 string for embedding into .
-   **/tmp/logo_base64.txt**
    -   **Importance**: A temporary file created to store the complete, correct base64 string of the logo.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Created and written with the valid base64 string.

<current_work>
The current work focuses on resolving a critical bug: the Leemaz application's logo was not displaying due to a corrupted  constant in . The AI engineer successfully diagnosed this, located the correct  asset in , and generated a new, valid base64 string.

Initial attempts to update  using the  tool failed due to input validation errors. Subsequent attempts with  commands also appeared unsuccessful. The AI then resorted to using a Python script to perform the string replacement in . After running the Python script, a  command showed the  constant now contained the correct base64 data. However, the AI's final internal assessment still indicated a concern about remnant of the old corrupted string and a desire to check that my replacement worked properly, suggesting the logo fix, while likely complete, still requires a final verification step.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the logo replacement in  to ensure no remnants of the old string persist and that the fix is complete.
