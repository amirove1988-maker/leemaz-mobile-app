The AI engineer successfully transformed the Leemaz e-commerce web application into an Expo mobile app. The initial phases involved extensive backend API development and mobile frontend creation, including crucial fixes for Pydantic v2 compatibility and navigation. Subsequent work included implementing an admin shop approval system, dynamic credit pricing, and shop logo functionality. After resolving a critical duplicate declaration error and a tunnel conflict, the app's core login functionality was fixed, and it was declared production-ready.

The work then shifted to delivering the app as an APK/AAB. The process was challenging due to environment-specific build issues (ARM64, Android SDK, EAS CLI authentication,  validation). The AI iteratively attempted various build strategies, including local Gradle builds and EAS cloud builds, continuously refining configurations and providing detailed instructions for the user to perform tasks locally. Despite multiple system reinitializations and build failures, an APK was successfully generated via EAS. However, the user reported that this APK failed to open on Android devices, leading to the current task: debugging and fixing the runtime issues to create a stable, working APK.

The goal is to develop Leemaz, a native mobile e-commerce application for Syrian women entrepreneurs, mirroring an existing React + FastAPI + MongoDB web app. It needs to support Android and iOS with React Native/Expo. Core functionalities include user registration (initially email verification, later replaced by admin approval), buyer/seller roles, shop creation, product listings, a configurable credit system, base64 image uploads, product reviews, real-time chat, favorites, push notifications, and bilingual support (Arabic/English RTL). The app requires Leemaz branding (butterfly logo, luxury pink/purple theme), mobile-optimized UI/UX, and an admin panel for user/credit/shop management. The backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT) must be preserved. Key implemented changes include removing email verification, adding an admin shop approval process, dynamic credit pricing control, and a cash-on-delivery payment system.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Push Notifications (Frontend Integration)**: Backend APIs are ready, but frontend integration (device token registration, sending/receiving) is pending.
-   **Debug Android App Not Opening**: The recently built APK fails to open on Android devices after scanning and downloading, indicating a runtime bug.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully generated an APK file for the Leemaz app using EAS Build in a GitHub Codespaces environment. However, the user reported that this APK, when scanned and downloaded to an Android device, was not opening and needed bug fixes.

The AI is currently in the process of diagnosing and resolving this runtime issue. It has proposed a methodical debugging approach:
1.  **Check Build Logs**: Reviewing the EAS build logs for warnings or errors specific to the last successful build.
2.  **Minimal Working Version**: Creating an ultra-minimal version of , , and  to isolate the problem.

3.  **Clean Install**: Removing , , and  then reinstalling dependencies and clearing the EAS build cache.
4.  **Rebuild Minimal Version**: Attempting to build the simplified application again via An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username.

This approach aims to establish a stable baseline that can open on Android, after which features can be progressively added back and retested to pinpoint the exact cause of the original crash.
