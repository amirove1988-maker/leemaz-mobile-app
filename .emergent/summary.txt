The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining and stabilizing a mocked Expo Go frontend application, addressing critical UI/UX and functional discrepancies. The trajectory began with a pre-existing analysis highlighting persistent Android APK build failures via EAS and several non-functional mocked features. The engineer systematically tackled user feedback, first by implementing role-based restrictions, making admin panel buttons functional (with mocked logic), and attempting to resolve app icon issues. This involved iterative changes to , , and , alongside creating comprehensive single-file Snack code versions for user testing. Subsequent iterations refined the logo implementation from emoji to a proper image, added mobile number validation for sellers, and adjusted screen sizing. The work culminated in delivering a final comprehensive mocked frontend, addressing all immediate user feedback on button functionality, logout, and a dedicated settings screen, while the core EAS build failures and full backend integration remain unaddressed in the provided trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The Leemaz project aims to be a native e-commerce mobile application for Syrian women entrepreneurs, mirroring an existing web app (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). It targets Android and iOS using React Native/Expo. Core features include user registration, buyer/seller/admin roles, shop creation, product listings, a configurable credit system, base64 image uploads, product reviews, real-time chat, favorites, push notifications, and bilingual support (Arabic/English RTL). The app requires Leemaz branding (butterfly logo, pink/purple theme), mobile-optimized UI/UX, and an admin panel for user/credit/shop management. The backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT) must be preserved. So far, the AI engineer has implemented removal of email verification, admin shop approval, dynamic credit pricing, and a cash-on-delivery payment system in the backend. On the frontend, a comprehensive, state-managed application demonstrating these features (with mock data) runs successfully in Expo Go, but direct APK builds via EAS are consistently failing, and several mocked features are not yet functional from a user interaction perspective.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo**: Primary mobile development framework.
-   **Expo Router**: Used initially but later simplified for direct state management.
-   **FastAPI/MongoDB/JWT**: Backend API, database, and authentication.
-   **State Management (React Context/useState)**: For mocked frontend application state.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client (mentioned, though mock uses internal state).
-   **Base64 Image Handling**: For shop logo uploads.
-   **Bilingual Support (RTL)**: Arabic/English language and layout.
-   **EAS Build**: Expo Application Services for cloud APK/AAB builds (unresolved issues).
-   **Gradle/Kotlin**: Native Android build system (central to build failures).

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: Original Expo entry point. Likely the base for the comprehensive mocked app, though the full code was later consolidated into single Snack files.
-   ****: Modified to include the Request Credits button for sellers and integrate logout functionality.
-   ****: Modified to implement role-based restrictions, preventing sellers from buying products.
-   ****: Significantly modified to implement basic, mocked user and product management interfaces, and to display the application logo. The manage users and products sections now offer descriptive alerts.
-   ** and **: These were examined and confirmed to have a comprehensive chat system implemented.
-   ****: Expo configuration. Previously modified for app icon settings; in the trajectory, the logo was implemented via UI components rather than  directly.
-   ** (and )**: These image files were downloaded and referenced in the UI components for the actual butterfly logo display, replacing previous emoji-based solutions.
-   ****: This is the most critical file representing the final state of the *mocked frontend application*. It's a single, self-contained JavaScript file encapsulating all features, fixes (logo, role-based, screen sizing, logout, settings, chat), and mock data delivered to the user for Expo Snack testing.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Integration**: The current functional frontend still uses mocked data; real backend integration for authentication, shop/product/order management, chat, notifications, and admin actions is pending.
-   **Push Notifications (Full Integration)**: User requested to check push notification, implying further verification or implementation is needed for this feature beyond basic backend service existence.
-   **Resolve EAS Build Failures**: Persistent failures when building a standalone Android APK via Expo Application Services (EAS) remain unresolved.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback on the  file (provided in Chat Message 102). The user reported:
1.  All buttons needing a check to ensure functionality.
2.  The logout button not working for all users.
3.  Absence of a Settings screen within the app.

In response, the AI engineer planned to rectify these issues, focusing on making all buttons functional (likely through mock alerts or navigation within the single-file app), ensuring a working logout mechanism for all user types, and implementing a proper Settings screen. This work culminated in the creation and delivery of  (Chat Message 104), which was then presented to the user with a summary of all implemented fixes and an instruction to test it. This final code is a self-contained, state-managed React Native application with comprehensive UI for login/register, home, shop, profile, chat, admin panel, and settings, featuring mock data, role-based access, Syria mobile number validation, correct screen sizing, and the official butterfly logo.
