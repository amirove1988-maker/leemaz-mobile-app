The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around stabilizing and debugging the Leemaz Expo mobile application, particularly to resolve persistent Android APK build and runtime issues. Initially, the core problem was an APK that failed to launch on Android devices, despite several successful EAS cloud builds. The debugging trajectory was arduous, marked by repeated attempts to resolve dependency conflicts (React, React Native, Expo SDK versions), Gradle/Java compatibility issues, and native asset () processing errors, often leading to a loop of  and An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username failures across various build phases.

A significant breakthrough came when the app's basic functionality was confirmed on the user's Android 15 device via Expo Go, indicating device and foundational code compatibility. This shifted the focus back to EAS build configurations, leading to attempts to align SDK versions (up to 54) and re-engineer the native build process (Gradle, Kotlin). Despite this, direct EAS APK builds continued to fail. Eventually, a fully-featured, state-managed frontend mock was successfully run in Expo Go, confirming the app's UI/UX responsiveness. The current state reflects a functional app in Expo Go, but with several mocked features explicitly identified by the user as non-functional, and the app icon still unaddressed.

<product_requirements>
The Leemaz project aims to be a native e-commerce mobile application for Syrian women entrepreneurs, mirroring an existing web app (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). It targets Android and iOS using React Native/Expo. Core features include user registration, buyer/seller/admin roles, shop creation, product listings, a configurable credit system, base64 image uploads, product reviews, real-time chat, favorites, push notifications, and bilingual support (Arabic/English RTL). The app requires Leemaz branding (butterfly logo, pink/purple theme), mobile-optimized UI/UX, and an admin panel for user/credit/shop management. The backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT) must be preserved. So far, the AI engineer has implemented removal of email verification, admin shop approval, dynamic credit pricing, and a cash-on-delivery payment system in the backend. On the frontend, a comprehensive, state-managed application demonstrating these features (with mock data) runs successfully in Expo Go, but direct APK builds via EAS are consistently failing, and several mocked features are not yet functional from a user interaction perspective.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo**: Primary mobile development framework.
-   **Expo Router**: Used initially for navigation but later abandoned for simpler structures during debugging.
-   **FastAPI**: Backend API development.
-   **MongoDB**: Database.
-   **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication.
-   **Zustand/Context API**: Used for state management (mocked in frontend).
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests.
-   **Base64 Image Handling**: For shop logo uploads.
-   **Admin Approval Workflow**: For shops and credit management.
-   **Bilingual Support (RTL)**: Arabic/English language and layout.
-   **EAS Build**: Expo Application Services for cloud APK/AAB builds.
-   **Android 15 Compatibility**: Addressing specific SDK and permission requirements for newer Android versions.
-   **Gradle/Kotlin**: Native build system and language, central to build failures.
-   **npm/Yarn**: Package managers for dependency resolution.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: Main FastAPI application. Updated for admin approval, credit pricing, shop logo upload, and push notifications.
-   ****: MongoDB data models. Updated for Pydantic v2 compatibility,  (credit pricing), and  ().
-   ****: Original Expo entry point. Frequently modified, often simplified or replaced by a root  during debugging to isolate issues.

-   ****: Various screens (e.g., , , , , , ) were initially described as being modified or created for features like admin controls, logo uploads, and order management.
-   ****: Manages tab navigation. Updated for Orders tab, bilingual text, and RTL layouts.
-   ** & **: Files created for comprehensive bilingual (Arabic/English) support and RTL layout.
-   ****: Expo configuration. Frequently modified throughout the trajectory for app icon, splash screen, Android package, , , , , and  settings, especially when attempting Android 15 compatibility.
-   ** (and later root )**: EAS build configuration. Repeatedly modified to adjust , , and environment variables like , .
-   **,  (and later root  files)**: Android native build configurations. Heavily modified in attempts to resolve Java/Gradle/Kotlin version compatibility for local and EAS builds.
-   ** (root)**: A key file created and iteratively updated outside the  directory in attempts to build a minimal and then a full-featured mocked app. The *latest version* provided includes comprehensive state-managed UI for all core features (Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, Shops, Orders, Favorites, Notifications, Profile, Chat, Admin Panel) with mock data and bilingual support.
-   ** (root)**: Created as a traditional entry point for some minimal builds.
-   ****: Placeholder for the app icon, leading to image processing errors when it was a text file.

The codebase underwent significant modifications focused on debugging build processes and establishing a functional, albeit mocked, frontend.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix non-functional mocked features**: The user explicitly noted that manage credit, approve shops, manage users buttons are not working, and that role-based buying/selling (seller cannot buy, should have request credit button) is not correctly implemented in the mocked frontend.
-   **Ensure actual logo for icon**: The user still reports not seeing the intended butterfly logo for the app icon.
-   **Backend Integration**: The current functional app uses mocked frontend data; real backend integration is still pending for the full feature set.
-   **Push Notifications (Full Integration)**: While a basic frontend service was created, full integration (sending/receiving, UI for preferences) and connection to the backend push logic are pending.
-   **Resolve EAS Build Failures**: Despite the app working in Expo Go, persistent failures when building a standalone APK via EAS need to be resolved.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully created a fully-featured, state-managed frontend mock of the Leemaz application. This version includes screens for Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, Shops, Orders, Favorites, Notifications, Profile, Chat, and an Admin Panel, complete with mock user accounts (buyer, seller, admin) and mock data for shops, products, orders, and notifications. It also features bilingual support (Arabic/English) and UI/UX optimized for mobile, and has been confirmed to run perfectly on the user's Samsung Galaxy A73 5G device with Android 15 via the Expo Go app.

The latest interaction (Chat Message 219) provided critical user feedback:
1.  **Non-functional buttons/features in mock**: The manage credit, approve shops, and manage users buttons in the Admin Panel are not functional (they are just UI, not wired to logic in the mock).
2.  **Role-based restrictions incomplete**: Sellers can currently buy and lack a request credit button, while buyers can sell, which is incorrect.
3.  **App icon issue**: The user still cannot see the intended butterfly logo for the app icon.
4.  **Push notifications check**: The user also requested to check push notification, implying further verification or implementation is needed for this feature.

The AI acknowledged this feedback in Chat Message 220, suggesting further testing of the comprehensive app (which refers to the provided mocked version) to confirm issues and then offering assistance for refinement or debugging. The current work therefore involves addressing this explicit feedback to make the mocked functionalities behave as expected and correctly display the app icon.
