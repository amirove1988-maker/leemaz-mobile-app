The AI engineer's work began by confirming the overall plan with the user, followed by an explicit request from the user to implement a seller subscription system. This system includes monthly/yearly plans, product limits (25 products), and a credit mechanism for additional products. The engineer tackled this by making extensive modifications to the monolithic  file. The process involved adding new state variables, functions for subscription logic, updating the  function, modifying the profile screen, creating and integrating subscription-related modals, and adding new styles. Throughout this, the  tool was used repeatedly, with one failure when attempting to remove an old function due to an empty replacement string. The logo fix from the previous session was verified as working, but attempts to test the new subscription feature via seller login and Arabic language display were hampered by login issues. The AI provided the full code, which initially resulted in a parsing error, but was corrected in the final message. The login issues remain unresolved, implying the subscription functionality is untested in a live user flow.

The Leemaz project is an Expo-based mobile e-commerce application designed for Syrian women entrepreneurs, complementing an existing web platform. It supports three user roles: Buyers (browse, favorite, contact sellers), Sellers (create shops, upload images), and Admins (platform oversight, credit requests). The application initially featured hardcoded data and logic within a single  file, a cash-on-delivery flow, and mocked push notifications. Branding requires consistent use of the official Leemaz logo, which was previously fixed. The app needs full bilingual (English/Arabic) support with Right-to-Left (RTL) layout. The monolithic  structure is recognized as a prototype limitation slated for future refactoring.

The most recent update requires implementing a seller subscription system:
-   **Monthly Plan**: 0/month, 7-day free trial, up to 25 products.
-   **Yearly Plan**: 00/year, 7-day free trial, up to 25 products.
-   **Product Credits**: For more than 25 products, sellers must buy credits at  per product, requiring admin confirmation.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development.
-   **Single-File Architecture**:  contains all frontend logic.
-   **Base64 Images**: Logo embedded as data URI.
-   **State Management**:  hook.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: Bilingual (EN/AR) and RTL support.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monolithic architecture, with the entire frontend contained within a single  file.

**Directory Structure:**



-   **/app/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: This is the primary frontend file, containing all React components, state, mock data, i18n strings, and styles. All new features are implemented directly in this file.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   The  constant was updated to fix a corrupted image display.
        -   New state variables were added for , , , , , , , , .
        -   New functions were added: , , , , , .
        -   The  function was modified to include checks against  and .
        -   The  component was updated to display subscription status, product usage, days until expiry, and buttons for managing subscriptions and requesting credits.
        -   The old  function was removed.
        -   New  components (, ) were added and integrated into the main render logic for both user and admin roles.
        -   Numerous new  styles were added for the subscription and credit request UI elements.
-   **/app/App_COMPLETE.js**
    -   **Importance**: A stable backup of the application's frontend.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No changes made.
-   **/app/test_result.md**
    -   **Importance**: Contains detailed product requirements, the original , and testing protocols.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Read at the start of the current work session.
-   **/app/frontend/assets/images/leemaz-logo.png**
    -   **Importance**: The original image asset for the Leemaz logo.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was accessed to generate the correct base64 string for embedding into  during the previous logo fix.

<pending_tasks>
-   Backend Integration: Replace mock data with live API calls.
-   Code Refactoring: Decompose  into a scalable structure.
-   Implement Real Push Notifications: Integrate a robust push notification service.
-   Build and Deployment: Resolve EAS build failures.
-   **Resolve Login Issues**: The login functionality is currently preventing full end-to-end testing of features.
-   **Test Arabic Language**: Full verification of RTL and Arabic translations after login.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved implementing a comprehensive seller subscription system into the monolithic  file. This included defining monthly (0) and yearly (00) plans, a 7-day free trial, and a 25-product limit. Beyond this limit, sellers must request credits at  per product, subject to admin approval.

The AI engineer successfully integrated the following:
-   **State Management**: New  variables to track subscription status, product count, credit requests, and modal visibility.
-   **Core Logic**: Functions to handle  (selecting monthly/yearly), , and associated confirmation flows.
-   **Product Limit Enforcement**: The  function was updated to check against the seller's product limit and subscription status.
-   **User Interface**: The  was enhanced to display subscription details, and new  components (, ) were added for subscription management and credit requests.
-   **Styling**: New styles for all new UI elements were added to .

The logo fix from the previous task was re-verified and confirmed to be working. However, attempts to test the newly implemented subscription system by logging in as a seller and verifying Arabic language support were unsuccessful due to persistent login failures in the . Despite these testing hurdles, the AI concluded the implementation was working and provided the full  code as requested by the user.
