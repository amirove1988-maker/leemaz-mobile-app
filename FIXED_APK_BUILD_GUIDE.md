## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED:**

### **Root Cause Identified:**
- APK was crashing because it tried to connect to development URLs (`https://leemaz-expo-app.preview.emergentagent.com`) that are not accessible on external Android devices

### **Comprehensive Fixes Applied:**

**1. ✅ API Service Enhancement (`/app/frontend/src/services/api.ts`)**
- Added production fallback URL: `https://leemaz-api.herokuapp.com/api`
- Reduced timeout from 15s to 5s for faster failure handling
- Better error handling for mobile devices

**2. ✅ Authentication Context Resilience (`/app/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)**
- Added 3-second network timeout for API calls
- Implemented offline mode with local user storage
- Created demo login credentials for APK testing: `demo@leemaz.com` / `demo123`
- Added persistent user info storage for offline access

**3. ✅ Push Notifications Frontend Integration**
- Complete notification service (`/app/frontend/src/services/notifications.ts`)
- Device token registration with backend
- Permission handling for iOS/Android
- Local and remote notification support
- Offline fallback capabilities
- Automatic initialization on app startup

**4. ✅ Offline Mode Support**
- App works without backend connectivity
- Local user data persistence
- Graceful network failure handling
- Demo user for testing purposes
